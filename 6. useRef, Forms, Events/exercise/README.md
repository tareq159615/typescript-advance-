# Typing `useRef`, Forms, and Events

## Objective

In this exercise, you'll practice typing React hooks such as `useRef`, handling forms, and typing events in TypeScript. You will create components that utilize these concepts with proper type annotations.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Typing `useRef`

1. Create a file named `FocusInput.tsx` in the `src` directory.

2. Define a component that uses `useRef` to focus an input field when a button is clicked. Type the ref appropriately.

### Step 2: Typing Forms

1. Create a file named `ContactForm.tsx` in the `src` directory.

2. Define a form component with typed state and form handlers.

### Step 3: Typing Events

1. Create a file named `EventHandling.tsx` in the `src` directory.

2. Define a component that demonstrates typing different event handlers.
